## Problem

Purchases in web3 usually involves the website asking the user to sign in with to their wallet. This is unpractical and unsafe for the average user as many websites could be phishing sites and clones. _It's like connecting your entire bank account to every website you visit, it's impractical._

One click on an unsafe website = money drained ðŸ˜¢

## Idea: Make a stripe like solution but with a twist & use of crypto wallets

 For example, buying shoes on Nike.com
1. User goes to checkout to purchase a pair of [Nike Dunks](https://www.nike.com/w/dunk-shoes-90aohzy7ok)
2. Chooses to pay with Solana -> a "payment wallet" gets generates 
3. User copies wallet address and the required amount
    - Business has access to generated wallet & receives the money
    - User paid for their Dunks without connecting to the Nike.com
    - End: both sides feels secure âœ…

## Key Feature ^^
User can use Phantom, Solflare, Backpack, any Solana wallet and send USDC or SOL to the generated public address, and confirm their payment without ever needing to connect their wallet to the website
